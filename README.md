To Create
1.Anti Disaster application
-Alerts users ahead of disasters
-Gives suitable measure to be taken to prevent or minimize the effect

2.Work plan
-The main cause for most of the disasters is increase global heat levels
-To counter tackle this we observe local and global heat levels 
-Set a boundary above which measures should be taken immediately to prevent it
-Predict the heat levels in the upcoming days 
-If under the limits maintain measures to reduce the heat level 
-In unavoidable conditions it sends user the alerts to the user to evacuate well ahead of the disaster occuring.

3.Data Set
-Previous disaster data
-Global heat sensing data
-Carbon  dioxide level sensing data
-Weather forecast data
-Vulnerable points data
-asteroid flow data 

4.Technology
-We us machine learning on our dataset
-With help of reinforcement learning on an ai wider scale,it is possible to feed in previous disaster data 
 and the available data sets to make out a relation and check whether it works for the available conditions.

5.Prediction
-From the result and matching data we can infer an Hypothesis and prove it to be true for disasters that have taken place
-With our final set of conditional logic we can predict upcoming disasters.
